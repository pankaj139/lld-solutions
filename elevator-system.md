# Elevator System

## Problem Statement

Design an intelligent elevator control system that can:

1. **Manage multiple elevator cars** in a building
2. **Handle internal and external requests** efficiently
3. **Implement optimal scheduling algorithms** to minimize wait times
4. **Support different movement strategies** (FIFO, SCAN, LOOK)
5. **Track elevator states and capacity** in real-time
6. **Handle emergency scenarios** and maintenance modes
7. **Provide system monitoring** and analytics

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Multiple elevator cars coordination
- Floor request handling (internal and external)
- Optimal elevator assignment algorithm
- Real-time status tracking
- Capacity management and overload protection
- Emergency stop and maintenance modes
- Performance analytics and monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Minimize average wait time
- Efficient energy consumption
- Handle peak hour traffic
- Reliable safety mechanisms
- Real-time responsiveness

## Design Patterns Used

1. **State Pattern**: Elevator state management (Idle, Moving Up/Down, Door Opening/Closing)
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different scheduling algorithms (FIFO, SCAN, LOOK)
3. **Observer Pattern**: Real-time status updates and monitoring
4. **Command Pattern**: Request processing and elevator operations
5. **Singleton Pattern**: Central elevator controller

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Distance and direction-based elevator assignment
- **Multi-algorithm Support**: Different scheduling strategies
- **Capacity Management**: Overload protection and passenger counting
- **Real-time Monitoring**: System status and performance tracking
- **Emergency Handling**: Safety mechanisms and maintenance modes

## Scheduling Algorithms

### Current Implementation (Hybrid)
- **Distance-based Assignment**: Closest available elevator
- **Direction Preference**: Favor elevators moving in same direction
- **Load Balancing**: Consider current request queue length

### Possible Extensions
- **SCAN Algorithm**: Elevator continues in direction until no more requests
- **LOOK Algorithm**: Changes direction when no more requests ahead
- **Destination Dispatch**: Advanced algorithm with destination prediction

## Time Complexity

- **Elevator Assignment**: O(n) where n is number of elevators
- **Request Processing**: O(1) for adding requests
- **Status Updates**: O(1) for individual elevator updates
- **Scheduling**: O(m log m) where m is pending requests

## Extension Points

1. **Destination Dispatch**: Passengers input destination before boarding
2. **AI Optimization**: Machine learning for traffic pattern prediction
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Smart power management and regenerative braking
4. **IoT Integration**: Sensor-based passenger counting and predictive maintenance
5. **Mobile Integration**: Elevator calling via smartphone app
