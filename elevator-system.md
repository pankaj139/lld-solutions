## Problem Statement

Design elevator control system for multi-story buildings with efficient floor scheduling.

## Requirements

- Multiple elevators in building
- Request elevator from any floor
- Efficient scheduling algorithm
- Track elevator direction and position
- Handle door operations

## Design Patterns

State, Strategy, Observer, Singleton, Command

## Time Complexity

- Request: O(e) where e is elevators
- Move: O(1)

## Space Complexity

- O(e) for elevators
- O(r) for requests
