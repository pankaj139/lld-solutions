# Online Shopping System

## üîó Implementation Links
- **Python Implementation**: [python/online-shopping/main.py](python/online-shopping/main.py)
- **JavaScript Implementation**: [javascript/online-shopping/main.js](javascript/online-shopping/main.js)

A comprehensive e-commerce platform demonstrating advanced object-oriented design patterns and real-world business logic.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components
- **User Management**: Customer, Seller, and Admin user types
- **Product Catalog**: Multi-category product management with inventory
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart with session management
- **Order Processing**: Complete order lifecycle with state management
- **Payment System**: Multiple payment methods with strategy pattern
- **Review System**: Product ratings and customer feedback
- **Notification System**: Real-time updates using observer pattern

## üéØ Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Strategy Pattern - Payment Processing
```python
# Multiple payment strategies
payment_strategy = PaymentStrategyFactory.create_payment_strategy(
    PaymentMethod.WALLET, customer)
payment_strategy.process_payment(amount, payment_info)
```

### 2. State Pattern - Order Management
```python
# Order state transitions
order.confirm()  # PENDING ‚Üí CONFIRMED
order.ship()     # CONFIRMED ‚Üí SHIPPED
order.deliver()  # SHIPPED ‚Üí DELIVERED
```

### 3. Observer Pattern - Notifications
```python
# Real-time notifications
shopping_system.attach(NotificationService())
shopping_system.attach(InventoryService())
# Automatic notifications on order events
```

### 4. Factory Pattern - Payment Strategy Creation
```python
# Factory creates appropriate payment processor
strategy = PaymentStrategyFactory.create_payment_strategy(
    payment_method, customer)
```

### 5. Command Pattern - Cart Operations
```python
# Encapsulated cart operations
cart.add_item(product, quantity)
cart.update_quantity(product_id, new_quantity)
cart.remove_item(product_id)
```
