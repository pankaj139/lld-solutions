# Sudoku Game

## Problem Statement

Design a sudoku puzzle game that can:

1. **Generate valid sudoku puzzles** with different difficulty levels
2. **Validate player moves** and detect conflicts
3. **Implement automatic solving** using backtracking algorithm
4. **Provide hints** and assistance features
5. **Track solving statistics** and best times

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Puzzle Generation**: Create valid 9x9 sudoku grids with unique solutions
- **Move Validation**: Check row, column, and 3x3 box constraints
- **Solving Algorithm**: Backtracking with constraint propagation
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, medium, hard based on given clues
- **Hint System**: Strategic hints without revealing full solution

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast puzzle generation and validation
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback for conflicts
- **Scalability**: Support for different grid sizes (4x4, 16x16)

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different solving algorithms and difficulty strategies
2. **Observer Pattern**: Cell update notifications
3. **Command Pattern**: Move operations with undo capability
4. **Template Method**: Common puzzle solving structure

## Extensions

1. **Variant Puzzles**: Diagonal sudoku, irregular shapes
2. **Multiplayer**: Competitive solving races
3. **Custom Puzzles**: User-created puzzle input
4. **Solving Techniques**: Advanced human-like solving strategies
