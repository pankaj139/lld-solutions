- **JavaScript Implementation**: [javascript/poker-game/main.js](javascript/poker-game/main.js)

## Problem Statement

Design a Texas Hold'em poker game system that can:

1. **Manage card deck operations** including shuffling, dealing, and card representation
2. **Evaluate poker hands** accurately according to standard poker hand rankings (Royal Flush to High Card)
3. **Handle multiple players** with individual chip stacks and betting actions
4. **Implement betting rounds** (Pre-flop, Flop, Turn, River) with proper turn management
5. **Support betting actions** including fold, check, call, raise, and all-in
6. **Calculate pot distribution** including side pots for all-in scenarios
7. **Determine winners** by comparing hand strengths with accurate tie-breaking

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Initialize standard 52-card deck with 4 suits and 13 ranks
- Shuffle deck using random algorithm ensuring fairness
- Deal two hole cards to each player at start of hand
- Deal community cards in stages (3 for flop, 1 for turn, 1 for river)
- Support 2-10 players per table
- Manage small blind and big blind positions rotating each hand
- Handle all betting actions (fold, check, call, raise, all-in) with validation
- Evaluate 5-card poker hands from 7 available cards (2 hole + 5 community)
- Compare hands to determine winner using standard poker rankings
- Distribute pot to winner(s), handling ties and side pots
- Track player chip stacks and eliminate players with zero chips

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Hand evaluation should execute in O(1) time using lookup tables or efficient algorithms
- Support hands with up to 10 players without performance degradation
- Betting validation should be instant (< 1ms)
- Card shuffle must be cryptographically random for fairness
- Side pot calculation must be accurate for complex all-in scenarios
- Clear console visualization of game state, cards, and betting actions

## Design Decisions

### Key Classes

1. **Card System**
   - `Card`: Represents individual playing card with rank and suit
   - `Deck`: Manages 52-card deck with shuffle and deal operations
   - `Rank`: Enum for card ranks (2-10, J, Q, K, A)
   - `Suit`: Enum for card suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades)

2. **Hand Evaluation**
   - `Hand`: Represents 5-card poker hand with ranking evaluation
   - `HandRanking`: Enum for hand types (High Card to Royal Flush)
   - `HandEvaluator`: Evaluates best 5-card hand from 7 cards

3. **Player Management**
   - `Player`: Represents player with hole cards, chips, and betting state
   - `PlayerAction`: Enum for betting actions (Fold, Check, Call, Raise, AllIn)
   - `PlayerState`: Tracks whether player is active, folded, or all-in

4. **Game Flow**
   - `PokerGame`: Main game controller managing rounds and betting
   - `GameStage`: Enum for betting rounds (PreFlop, Flop, Turn, River, Showdown)
   - `Pot`: Manages main pot and side pots for payouts
   - `BettingRound`: Handles one round of betting with turn rotation

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different hand evaluation strategies for various poker variants
2. **State Pattern**: Game stage management (PreFlop â†’ Flop â†’ Turn â†’ River â†’ Showdown)
3. **Chain of Responsibility**: Hand ranking evaluation chain (check flush, then straight, etc.)
4. **Factory Pattern**: Card and Hand creation with validation
5. **Observer Pattern**: Players observe game events (cards dealt, bets made, pot updates)
6. **Command Pattern**: Betting actions as command objects with validation and execution

### Key Features

- **Accurate Hand Ranking**: Correctly evaluates all poker hands including edge cases
- **Side Pot Management**: Handles multiple all-in scenarios with proper pot distribution
- **Blind Rotation**: Dealer button rotates clockwise each hand
- **Betting Validation**: Prevents invalid actions (raising less than minimum, checking when bet exists)
- **Best Hand Selection**: Chooses optimal 5-card combination from 7 available cards

## Usage Example

```python
# Create game with 4 players
game = PokerGame(
    player_names=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"],
    starting_chips=1000,
    small_blind=10,
    big_blind=20
)

# Play one hand
game.start_hand()

# Pre-flop betting
game.run_betting_round()  # Players make decisions

# Deal flop
game.deal_flop()
game.run_betting_round()

# Deal turn
game.deal_turn()
game.run_betting_round()

# Deal river
game.deal_river()
game.run_betting_round()

# Showdown
winners = game.determine_winners()
game.distribute_pot(winners)

# Display results
print(f"Winner: {winners[0].name}")
print(f"Winning hand: {winners[0].get_best_hand(game.community_cards)}")
```

## Business Rules

1. **Blind Rules**
   - Small blind posts half the minimum bet before cards are dealt
   - Big blind posts full minimum bet before cards are dealt
   - Dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand
   - Player to the left of big blind acts first pre-flop
   - Player to the left of dealer acts first on flop, turn, and river

2. **Betting Rules**
   - Minimum raise must be at least the size of the previous bet or raise
   - Player can only bet up to their total chip stack (all-in)
   - Check is only valid if no bet has been made in current round
   - Call matches the current highest bet in the round
   - Betting round ends when all active players have acted and matched the highest bet

3. **Hand Evaluation Rules**
   - Best 5-card hand is selected from player's 2 hole cards + 5 community cards
   - Royal Flush beats all other hands (A-K-Q-J-10 of same suit)
   - Ties are broken by comparing rank values in order
   - If hands are identical, pot is split equally among winners

4. **Pot Distribution Rules**
   - Player can only win chips up to their total investment in each pot
   - Side pots created when player goes all-in for less than current bet
   - Main pot awarded first, then side pots in order of creation
   - Ties result in pot being split equally (rounded down to nearest chip)

5. **Player Elimination Rules**
   - Player with zero chips is eliminated from game
   - Game continues until only one player remains with chips
   - Final player is declared winner
   - Players can rebuy chips (optional feature)

## Extension Points

1. **Multiple Poker Variants**: Add Omaha, Seven-Card Stud, Five-Card Draw
2. **Tournament Mode**: Multi-table tournaments with increasing blinds
3. **AI Players**: Implement AI with different playing styles (tight, aggressive, loose)
4. **Hand History**: Record and replay complete hand histories
5. **Statistics Tracking**: Player stats (hands played, win rate, showdown percentage)
6. **Table Chat**: Text chat functionality between players
7. **Animation**: Animated card dealing and chip movements
8. **Multi-Currency**: Support different chip denominations and cash games

## Security Considerations

- **Deck Shuffling**: Use cryptographically secure random number generator
- **Hole Card Privacy**: Ensure player's hole cards are not visible to others
- **Action Validation**: Validate all player actions server-side to prevent cheating
- **Pot Calculation**: Double-check pot math to prevent chip discrepancies
- **Hand Evaluation**: Use trusted hand evaluation library to prevent disputes

## Time Complexity

- **Hand Evaluation**: O(1) using lookup tables or O(n) for straightforward algorithm where n=7
- **Best Hand Selection**: O(C(7,5)) = O(21) constant time for all 5-card combinations
- **Pot Distribution**: O(p) where p is number of players for side pot calculation
- **Betting Round**: O(pÃ—r) where p is players and r is raises in one round
- **Winner Determination**: O(p log p) for sorting hands of active players
- **Deck Shuffle**: O(52) = O(1) for Fisher-Yates shuffle

## Space Complexity

- O(52) for deck storage (constant)
- O(p) where p is number of players for player data
- O(5) = O(1) for community cards
- O(p) for pot and side pot management
- O(1) for game state and betting round data
