# Design Patterns and OOP Concepts in JavaScript LLD Solutions

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the design patterns and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented across the JavaScript Low-Level Design (LLD) solutions. Each system demonstrates multiple patterns working together to create robust, maintainable, and scalable architectures.

## Design Patterns Summary

### 1. **Creational Patterns**

#### Factory Pattern

- **Location**: Chess Game (PieceFactory), Banking System (Account creation), Hotel Booking (Room creation)
- **Purpose**: Creates objects without specifying their exact classes
- **Benefits**: Centralized object creation, easy to extend with new types
- **Example**: `PieceFactory.createPiece(pieceType, color, position)`

#### Singleton Pattern

- **Location**: Elevator Controller, URL Shortener (central mapping), Task Management (game controller)
- **Purpose**: Ensures only one instance of a class exists
- **Benefits**: Global access point, resource management
- **Example**: Central elevator dispatch system

#### Builder Pattern

- **Location**: Online Shopping (complex orders), Hotel Booking (search criteria)
- **Purpose**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Benefits**: Flexible object construction, readable code
- **Example**: `RoomSearchCriteria` with multiple optional parameters

### 2. **Structural Patterns**

#### Decorator Pattern

- **Location**: Hotel Booking (room amenities), Banking System (account features), Task Management (enhanced tasks)
- **Purpose**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically
- **Benefits**: Flexible feature enhancement without inheritance
- **Example**: Adding amenities to hotel rooms

#### Facade Pattern

- **Location**: ATM System (simplified interface), Library Management, Online Shopping
- **Purpose**: Provides simplified interface to complex subsystems
- **Benefits**: Reduces complexity, improves usability
- **Example**: ATM interface hiding banking complexity

#### Composite Pattern

- **Location**: Chess Game (board/pieces), Task Management (project hierarchy), Parking Lot (spot collections)
- **Purpose**: Composes objects into tree structures
- **Benefits**: Uniform treatment of individual and composite objects
- **Example**: Chess board containing pieces

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**

#### State Pattern

- **Location**: ATM System (states), Hotel Booking (booking status), Chess Game (game status), Elevator System
- **Purpose**: Changes object behavior based on internal state
- **Benefits**: Clean state transitions, maintainable state logic
- **Example**: ATM states (IDLE → CARD_INSERTED → PIN_ENTERED → TRANSACTION_COMPLETED)

#### Strategy Pattern

- **Location**: Parking Lot (vehicle fitting), Chess Game (piece movements), Banking System (interest calculation)
- **Purpose**: Defines family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Benefits**: Flexible algorithm selection, easy to extend
- **Example**: Different chess piece movement strategies

#### Observer Pattern

- **Location**: Social Media (notifications), Banking System (fraud alerts), Task Management (updates)
- **Purpose**: Notifies multiple objects about state changes
- **Benefits**: Loose coupling, real-time updates
- **Example**: Real-time social media notifications

#### Command Pattern

- **Location**: Chess Game (moves), ATM System (transactions), Task Management (operations)
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Benefits**: Undo/redo functionality, request queuing
- **Example**: Chess moves as executable commands

#### Template Method Pattern

- **Location**: ATM System (transaction processing), Library Management (search workflows), Banking System
- **Purpose**: Defines algorithm skeleton, subclasses fill in details
- **Benefits**: Code reuse, consistent structure
- **Example**: Common transaction processing steps

#### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

- **Location**: Library Management (permissions), Task Management (approvals), Online Shopping (validation)
- **Purpose**: Passes requests along chain of handlers
- **Benefits**: Flexible request processing, decoupled handlers
- **Example**: Multi-level approval workflows

## OOP Concepts Implementation

### 1. **Encapsulation**

- **Private Methods**: Methods prefixed with `_` (JavaScript convention)
- **Data Hiding**: Internal state protected from direct access
- **Examples**:
  - ATM Card PIN validation logic
  - Parking spot availability checking
  - User authentication in Banking System

### 2. **Inheritance**

- **Base Classes**: Abstract classes like `Vehicle`, `User`, `Piece`
- **Specialization**: Concrete implementations with specific behavior
- **Examples**:
  - `Vehicle → Motorcycle/Car/Truck` (Parking Lot)
  - `Piece → King/Queen/Rook/Bishop/Knight/Pawn` (Chess Game)
  - `User → Member/Librarian/Admin` (Library Management)

### 3. **Polymorphism**

- **Method Overriding**: Same method names, different implementations
- **Interface Consistency**: Same interface across different types
- **Examples**:
  - `getPossibleMoves()` in chess pieces
  - `processPayment()` in different payment methods
  - `calculateFee()` in various account types

### 4. **Abstraction**

- **Abstract Classes**: Base classes that cannot be instantiated
- **Interface Definition**: Clear contracts for implementations
- **Examples**:
  - Abstract `User` class in Library Management
  - Abstract `Vehicle` class in Parking Lot
  - Abstract `Piece` class in Chess Game

### 5. **Composition**

- **Has-A Relationships**: Objects containing other objects
- **Complex Structures**: Building complex systems from simpler parts
- **Examples**:
  - ATM contains CashDispenser and BankingService
  - Hotel contains Rooms and Bookings
  - Elevator System contains Cars and Floors

### 6. **Association**

- **Relationships**: Objects that use or reference other objects
- **Loose Coupling**: Objects interact but maintain independence
- **Examples**:
  - User associated with multiple Bookings
  - Posts associated with Users in Social Media
  - Tasks associated with Users in Task Management

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **SOLID Principles**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes are substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused, minimal interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 2. **Clean Code Principles**

- **Meaningful Names**: Clear, descriptive class and method names
- **Small Functions**: Functions do one thing well
- **Comments**: Explain the why, not the what
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation

### 3. **Design Principles**

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Code reuse through inheritance and composition
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Build what you need, when you need it
