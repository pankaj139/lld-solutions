"""
BATTLESHIP GAME SYSTEM - Low Level Design Implementation in Python

DESIGN PATTERNS USED:
1. STRATEGY PATTERN: Different AI difficulty levels and attack strategies
   - Random attack strategy for easy difficulty
   - Hunt and target strategy for medium difficulty
   - Probability density mapping for hard difficulty
   - Statistical analysis for expert level AI

2. STATE PATTERN: Game state management with clear transitions
   - Game states: SETUP -> PLACING_SHIPS -> PLAYING -> GAME_OVER
   - Ship states: INTACT -> HIT -> SUNK
   - Cell states: EMPTY -> SHIP -> HIT -> MISS
   - Each state has specific allowed operations and validations

3. COMMAND PATTERN: Game actions as command objects
   - Attack commands with coordinate validation
   - Ship placement commands with collision detection
   - Undo/redo support for setup phase
   - Move history tracking for game replay

4. OBSERVER PATTERN: Game event notifications
   - Hit/miss notifications with visual and audio feedback
   - Ship sunk alerts with celebration effects
   - Game over notifications with final statistics
   - Turn change notifications for multiplayer coordination

5. FACTORY PATTERN: Ship creation with different types and sizes
   - ShipFactory creates different ship types (Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, etc.)
   - Proper ship initialization with size and orientation validation
   - Easy extension for custom ship types and configurations
   - Centralized ship creation logic with game rules

6. TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERN: Game flow structure
   - Standard game loop: setup -> place ships -> take turns -> check win
   - Customizable AI decision making within standard framework
   - Consistent game rules enforcement across all game modes
   - Extensible framework for game variants

OOP CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:
- INHERITANCE: Ship hierarchy with different ship types and behaviors
- ENCAPSULATION: Board state and ship positions hidden behind controlled interface
- ABSTRACTION: Complex game logic abstracted into simple method calls
- POLYMORPHISM: Different player types (human/AI) handled uniformly

SOLID PRINCIPLES:
- SRP: Each class handles single responsibility (Board, Ship, Player, Game)
- OCP: Easy to add new ship types and AI strategies without code changes
- LSP: All ship types and player types can be used interchangeably
- ISP: Focused interfaces for game operations, board management, AI strategies
- DIP: Game logic depends on player abstractions, not concrete implementations

BUSINESS FEATURES:
- Single player vs AI with multiple difficulty levels
- Multiplayer support with turn-based gameplay
- Customizable board sizes and ship configurations
- Game statistics tracking and leaderboards
- Replay system with move history
- Save/load game functionality for long sessions

ARCHITECTURAL NOTES:
- Clean separation between game logic and AI strategies
- Modular board representation for different game variants
- Extensible AI system for easy strategy addition
- Event-driven architecture for real-time multiplayer
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent gameplay
