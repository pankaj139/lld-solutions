# Ride Sharing System

## Problem Statement

Design a ride-sharing platform like Uber/Lyft that can:

1. **Manage riders and drivers** with real-time location tracking
2. **Handle ride requests and matching** with optimal driver assignment
3. **Implement dynamic pricing** with surge pricing during peak hours
4. **Track ride lifecycle** from request to completion
5. **Process payments and earnings** distribution
6. **Support multiple vehicle types** with different pricing tiers
7. **Provide ride analytics** and user ratings

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- User registration for riders and drivers
- Real-time location tracking and updates
- Ride request and driver matching
- Dynamic fare calculation with surge pricing
- Ride tracking and status updates
- Payment processing and driver earnings
- Rating system for both riders and drivers
- Ride history and analytics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Handle thousands of concurrent rides
- Sub-second driver matching
- Real-time location updates
- Reliable payment processing
- High availability during peak hours

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different pricing strategies (standard, surge, premium)
2. **State Pattern**: Ride status management (Requested → Assigned → In Progress → Completed)
3. **Observer Pattern**: Real-time location updates and notifications
4. **Factory Pattern**: User and vehicle creation
5. **Template Method**: Common ride operations with specific implementations

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Matching**: Distance and rating-based driver assignment
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Surge pricing during peak hours and high demand
- **Real-time Tracking**: GPS-based location updates
- **Multi-tier Service**: Economy, Premium, and Luxury vehicle options
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Ride statistics and earnings tracking

## Pricing Algorithm

- **Base Fare**: Fixed starting amount per vehicle type
- **Distance Rate**: Per-kilometer pricing
- **Surge Multiplier**: Dynamic pricing based on demand and time
- **Minimum Fare**: Guaranteed minimum charge

## Time Complexity

- **Driver Matching**: O(n log n) where n is available drivers
- **Location Updates**: O(1) for individual updates
- **Fare Calculation**: O(1) with strategy pattern
- **Ride History**: O(m) where m is user's ride count

## Extension Points

1. **Pool Rides**: Multiple passengers sharing rides
2. **Scheduled Rides**: Advance booking functionality
3. **Multi-stop Routes**: Support for multiple destinations
4. **Electric Vehicle Priority**: Green vehicle incentives
5. **Corporate Accounts**: Business travel management
