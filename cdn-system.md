- **JavaScript Implementation**: [javascript/cdn-system/main.js](javascript/cdn-system/main.js)

## Problem Statement
Design a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that can:
1. Route user requests to the nearest edge server
2. Cache content efficiently with TTL and eviction policies
3. Optimize content delivery through compression
4. Handle cache invalidation across multiple servers

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Geographic routing to nearest edge servers
- Multi-level caching with LRU eviction
- Content compression for faster delivery
- Cache invalidation notifications
- Basic health monitoring of edge servers

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Sub-100ms response times for cached content
- 90%+ cache hit ratio
- Horizontal scalability through edge server addition
- Failover to backup servers when needed

## Design Patterns Used
1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different routing algorithms (geographic vs latency-based)
2. **Proxy Pattern**: Edge servers proxy requests to origin servers
3. **Observer Pattern**: Cache invalidation notifications across servers

## Key Discussion Points
- **Geographic vs Latency-based Routing**: How to balance proximity with server load
- **Cache Eviction Strategies**: When to use LRU vs TTL-based eviction
- **Consistency vs Performance**: Trade-offs in cache invalidation timing
- **Edge Server Placement**: Cost vs performance optimization

## Extensions
1. Add real-time analytics and monitoring dashboard
2. Implement intelligent cache warming based on usage patterns
3. Add security features like DDoS protection and rate limiting
4. Support for dynamic content caching with edge-side includes
