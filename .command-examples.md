# Testing Your Custom Commands

This file contains examples to test your custom slash commands.

## Test 1: Create a Simple System

Try creating a simple calculator system:

```text
/create-lld calculator data-structure easy
```

The AI should ask you for:
- Core capabilities
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Design patterns to use

Expected output:
- `calculator.md` with full documentation
- `python/calculator/main.py` with implementation
- `javascript/calculator/main.js` with implementation
- Updated `README.md`

## Test 2: Analyze an Existing System

Try analyzing the ATM system:

```text
/analyze-lld atm-system
```

Expected output:
- Code quality analysis
- Design pattern suggestions
- Missing edge cases
- Documentation review
- Performance improvements

## Test 3: Extend an Existing System

Try adding a feature:

```text
/extend-lld parking-lot-system add reservation system with advance booking
```

Expected output:
- Updated markdown documentation
- Updated Python implementation
- Updated JavaScript implementation
- New demo code showing the feature

## Test 4: Generate Tests

Try generating test cases:

```text
/test-lld atm-system
```

Expected output:
- `python/atm-system/test_main.py` with pytest tests
- `javascript/atm-system/test.js` with jest tests

## Test 5: Compare Systems

Try comparing two systems:

```text
/compare-lld atm-system vending-machine-system
```

Expected output:
- Common patterns analysis
- Unique patterns in each
- Structural differences
- Recommendations

## How to Use

1. Open Cursor in this workspace
2. Type any of the commands above in the chat
3. The AI will recognize the command and execute it
4. Follow the prompts if any additional information is needed
5. Review the generated files

## Command Syntax Reference

```text
/create-lld <name> <category> <difficulty>
  name: kebab-case (e.g., streaming-service)
  category: system-design | game-design | business-system | data-structure
  difficulty: easy | medium | hard

/analyze-lld <name>
  name: existing system name (e.g., atm-system)

/extend-lld <name> <feature-description>
  name: existing system name
  feature-description: natural language description of the feature

/test-lld <name>
  name: existing system name

/compare-lld <name1> <name2>
  name1, name2: existing system names
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Working?

1. Ensure `.cursorrules` file exists in workspace root
2. Restart Cursor to reload the rules
3. Check that you're using the exact command syntax

### AI Not Following Template?

1. Check `.cursorrules` has not been modified
2. Ensure you're providing all required parameters
3. Try being more specific in your requirements

### Generated Code Has Issues?

1. Use `/analyze-lld <name>` to get suggestions
2. Manually review and fix issues
3. Report consistent problems for template improvements
