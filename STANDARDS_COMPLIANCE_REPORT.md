**Recommendation**: Complete rewrite following ATM standard (expand from 44 to ~200 lines)

---

#### 27. **Snake Game**
**Status**: Minimally Compliant (~44 lines)
**Missing**: Same as Tic-Tac-Toe
**Recommendation**: Complete rewrite following ATM standard

---

---

### 🌟 SPECIAL CASE - DIFFERENT FORMAT

#### 33. **Snake and Ladder Game**
**Status**: Comprehensive but Non-Standard Format (~618 lines)

**What it has**:
- ✅ Extensive problem statement
- ✅ Detailed functional & non-functional requirements
- ✅ Multiple design patterns with code examples
- ✅ Comprehensive class diagrams
- ✅ Algorithm descriptions
- ✅ API design
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Board representation
- ✅ Game flow
- ✅ Statistics section
- ✅ AI implementation details
- ✅ Testing strategy
- ✅ Extension points
- ✅ Interview discussion points

**What's different**:
- ❌ Doesn't follow ATM system format structure
- ❌ Has academic/tutorial style instead of quick reference
- ❌ No quick "Usage Example" section
- ❌ No standard "Business Rules" section
- ❌ No "Security Considerations"
- ❌ No "Time/Space Complexity" summary

**Recommendation**: This is a trade-off case
- **Option A**: Reformat to match ATM standard (lose detailed explanations)
- **Option B**: Keep detailed format but add ATM standard sections at top
- **Option C**: Keep as-is as "extended format" example

**Suggested Action**: Add ATM-style summary sections at top, keep detailed content below
