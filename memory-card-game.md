# Memory Card Game

## Problem Statement

Design a memory card matching game that can:

1. **Implement card shuffling** and grid layout
2. **Handle card flipping** with match detection
3. **Track timing** and scoring with difficulty levels
4. **Provide progressive challenges** with larger grids
5. **Support different themes** and card types

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Card Grid**: Configurable grid sizes (4x4, 6x6, 8x8)
- **Card Matching**: Two-card flip with automatic hiding on mismatch
- **Timer System**: Track solving time for scoring
- **Difficulty Levels**: Different grid sizes and time constraints
- **Theme Support**: Various card images and styles

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Smooth card animations and transitions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimal image loading and caching
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual indicators for matches

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Observer Pattern**: Match notifications and score updates
2. **State Pattern**: Card states (hidden, revealed, matched)
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Different difficulty algorithms
4. **Factory Pattern**: Card creation with themes

## Extensions

1. **Multiplayer**: Turn-based competitive memory games
2. **Progressive Levels**: Increasing difficulty with rewards
3. **Custom Themes**: User-uploaded image sets
4. **Achievement System**: Unlockable rewards and statistics
