- **Python Implementation**: [python/memory-card-game/main.py](python/memory-card-game/main.py)
- **JavaScript Implementation**: [javascript/memory-card-game/main.js](javascript/memory-card-game/main.js)

## Problem Statement

Design a Memory Card matching game system that can:

1. **Manage card grid** with configurable board sizes (4Ã—4, 6Ã—6, 8Ã—8)
2. **Handle card flipping** with face-up and face-down states
3. **Detect matching pairs** when two cards are revealed
4. **Support multiple players** with turn-based gameplay
5. **Track game statistics** including moves, time, and matches found
6. **Implement difficulty levels** affecting board size and card types
7. **Provide single-player mode** with timer and high score tracking

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Initialize game board with pairs of matching cards (e.g., 4Ã—4 board = 8 pairs)
- Shuffle cards randomly at game start to ensure different layouts
- Allow player to flip two cards per turn
- Reveal card content when flipped
- Check if two flipped cards match
- Keep matched pairs face-up permanently
- Flip non-matching cards back face-down after brief display
- Track number of moves/attempts made
- Support 1-4 players with turn rotation
- Detect game completion when all pairs are matched
- Calculate and display final score based on moves and time

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Card flip animation should be smooth (simulated in console with delay)
- Match detection should be instant (< 1ms)
- Support board sizes from 4Ã—4 to 8Ã—8 (8 to 32 pairs)
- Game state should be easily serializable for save/load
- Clear visual representation showing card states
- Extensible for different card themes (numbers, letters, symbols, images)

## Design Decisions

### Key Classes

1. **Card System**
   - `Card`: Individual card with symbol/value and state
   - `CardState`: Enum for card states (FaceDown, FaceUp, Matched)
   - `CardPair`: Represents matching pair of cards

2. **Board Management**
   - `Board`: Grid of cards with position tracking
   - `Position`: Row and column coordinates
   - `Difficulty`: Enum for board sizes (Easy: 4Ã—4, Medium: 6Ã—6, Hard: 8Ã—8)

3. **Game Logic**
   - `Turn`: Represents player's turn with two card selections
   - `Move`: Single card flip action
   - `MatchChecker`: Validates if two cards match

4. **Player System**
   - `Player`: Represents player with score and statistics
   - `PlayerStats`: Tracks matches found, moves made, accuracy

5. **Game Management**
   - `Game`: Main controller managing game flow
   - `GameState`: Enum for states (Setup, Playing, Paused, Finished)
   - `Timer`: Tracks elapsed time for single-player mode
   - `ScoreCalculator`: Computes final score based on performance

### Design Patterns Used

1. **State Pattern**: Card state management (FaceDown â†’ FaceUp â†’ Matched)
2. **Observer Pattern**: Game event notifications (match found, turn complete, game over)
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Different difficulty levels with board size strategies
4. **Memento Pattern**: Save/restore game state for undo functionality
5. **Factory Pattern**: Card creation with symbol assignment
6. **Command Pattern**: Turn/move as reversible command

### Key Features

- **Automatic Shuffling**: Random card placement at game start
- **Match Detection**: Instant validation of card pairs
- **Turn Management**: Proper rotation in multiplayer mode
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive game metrics
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjustable board sizes

## Usage Example

```python
# Create game with 2 players, medium difficulty
game = MemoryCardGame(
    player_names=["Alice", "Bob"],
    difficulty=Difficulty.MEDIUM
)

# Start game
game.start_game()

# Display board
game.board.display()

# Player makes move (flip first card)
position1 = Position(2, 3)
card1 = game.flip_card(position1)

# Flip second card
position2 = Position(1, 4)
card2 = game.flip_card(position2)

# Check for match
if game.check_for_match():
    print(f"Match found! {game.current_player.name} scores!")
else:
    print("No match. Next player's turn.")
    game.next_turn()

# Check if game complete
if game.is_game_complete():
    winner = game.get_winner()
    print(f"Game Over! Winner: {winner.name}")
    print(f"Final Score: {winner.score}")
```

## Business Rules

1. **Card Setup Rules**
   - Board must have even number of cards (pairs)
   - Each symbol/value appears exactly twice
   - Cards are shuffled randomly at game start
   - All cards start face-down
   - Once matched, cards stay face-up permanently

2. **Turn Rules**
   - Player flips exactly two cards per turn
   - First card stays revealed until second card is flipped
   - If cards match, player scores and gets another turn (optional rule)
   - If cards don't match, both flip back after brief delay
   - Cannot flip already matched cards
   - Cannot flip same card twice in one turn

3. **Matching Rules**
   - Cards match if they have identical symbol/value
   - Match must be validated immediately after second flip
   - Matched pairs contribute to player's score
   - Matched cards remain face-up for rest of game

4. **Scoring Rules**
   - Each match worth 10 points
   - Bonus points for consecutive matches (combo multiplier)
   - Time bonus in single-player mode (faster = higher score)
   - Accuracy bonus for high match rate (matches/total_moves)
   - Efficiency rating: (matches Ã— 2) / total_moves Ã— 100

5. **Victory Conditions**
   - Game ends when all pairs are matched
   - In multiplayer, player with most matches wins
   - In single-player, compare time/moves to high score
   - Tie-breaker: fewer moves wins

## Extension Points

1. **Themes**: Add card themes (animals, fruits, colors, custom images)
2. **Power-Ups**: Peek at random card, reveal all briefly, extra flip
3. **Challenges**: Time limits, move limits, memory tests
4. **Multiplayer Online**: Network play with turn synchronization
5. **Leaderboards**: Global/local high score tracking
6. **Achievements**: Unlock badges for milestones
7. **Custom Boards**: Non-rectangular layouts, obstacles
8. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for flips, matches, wins

## Time Complexity

- **Card Shuffle**: O(n) where n is number of cards
- **Card Flip**: O(1) - Direct position access
- **Match Check**: O(1) - Compare two card symbols
- **Board Display**: O(rÃ—c) where r is rows, c is columns
- **Game Complete Check**: O(n) - Check all cards matched
- **Get Winner**: O(p) where p is number of players

## Space Complexity

- O(rÃ—c) for board grid where r and c are dimensions
- O(n) for card list where n is total cards
- O(t) for turn history where t is number of turns
- O(p) for player list where p is number of players
- O(1) for game state and current player tracking
